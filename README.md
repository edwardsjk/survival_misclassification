# survival_misclassification

This repository provides example data and code for the paper "Risk functions with outcome misclassification," currently in progress. 

The example presented here is based on an altered version of the STI reinfection data from the website 
for _Survival Analysis Techniques for Censored and Truncated Data, 2nd ed._ by Klein and Moeshberger and described in section 1.12 of the book.
